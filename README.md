# Forge-Launch-Project
This is the project that got me into the Forge Launch Data Science track with a 7% acceptance rate. It provides insights about how the world's happiness levels changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this dataset was to essentially quantify the happiness levels of 140+ countries using various factors such as their GDP per capita, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, etc. Specifically, I was interested in finding out if there was a significant drop in happiness in 2020, when COVID hit, and if people felt that their freedom to make life choices decreased substantially (due to quarantine, isolation, etc.).
